<em>"Why am I writing a reflection?"</em>

<p>I believe that writing a reflection will serve as a good reference for future me to see how I have improved my skills with each individual project. I am only a freshman-ish college student (it's complicated) at the moment, so for my age, really anything is better than nothing.</p>

<p>The idea behind this project was simply to refine the data skills I had gained though online courses, while also working on an interesting and applicable set of questions. In addition, I am now a bit more comfortable with sticking with the field of Data Science as a career path, as before I was a little skeptical that CS wouldn't turn me into some sort of anti-social denizen who lives in server rooms. After going through with a basic project, I'm now a fan of doing statistics and stuff as a career.</p>

<p>Because this project only consists of rudimentary exploratory data analysis, it is very unlikely this will end up on any sort of resume. Rather, this whole analysis serves as a "Look, I made a thing!" project. Using a survey-based approach allowed me to be in control of the entire analysis from start to finish, rather than using an online dataset with non-customizable datapoints to analyze.</p>

<p>There is a common theme of issues arising from having an insufficient sample size. With this format of project (small-scale web survey), there won't necessarily be a predictible number of datapoints in the dataset. If a large corporation were to create a similar survey, they would have the means to advertise it to a much larger audience.</p> 

<p>I did not personally send the survey to anybody, except those who asked after I told them about it. Using an totally opt-in approach to the participant selection had the effect of only including people who would be willing to take a random internet survey about their academic lives. This combined with the fact that half of the dataset came from a drum corps meme page on facebook likely resulted in skewing the data towards people who are already quite intelligent, while excluding people who don't care about school or grades. I have still been able to gather some useful insights from the data, but having participants from a wider range of academic standings might have allowed me to see more defined trends.</p>

<p>The datapoints I chose to collect were meaningful for the most part. Some questions such as number of hobbies and favorite color were sort of meaningless, and did not add much to the project. Using Typeform rather than Google Forms would increase the level of flexibility I have with survey questions.</p>

<p>As far as actual code portion is concerned, there is definitely room for improvement in regards to organization and neatness. Taking the time to comment the rest of my code would allow other people to read it easier. For many parts of the analysis, I used hacky work-arounds to get the data and graphs to do what I wanted them to. Improving on this will only come with more experience with things I'm unfamiliar with (mainly the datetime library). Using more of the advanced pandas functionality like pivot tables and groupby would have helped make things more straightforward and intuitive. Overall though, I was able to accomplish most of what I set out to do.</p>

<p>Using a webpage for the analysis results rather than a Jupyter notebook added a good amount of aesthetic and neatness to the overall project presentation. From the beginning, I had planned to present survey participants with the analysis results, so the actual presentation portion was something to be taken into consideration. I probably could have come up with more things to talk about than just regurgitating what the graphs already said, but the structure of the presentation was easy to follow. Including code snippets to accompany my process descriptions made sense for the most part, but for a general audience a better approach would have been to just describe why I was doing certain things without getting into the technical aspects of the data analysis.</p>

<p>When I started this project on Febuary 19th, I had planned to have it finished by early April. When early April rolled around, I realized I had drastically underestimated the amount of work I would have to put in to figure out certain aspects of the project. This is totally to be expected with no prior experience. I believe that I worked on the project consistantly, as evidenced by my Github commits. Now that I think about it, I really don't know why I commited my project everytime I made progress on it. Although I was able to use Github as a personal cloud to move work between my two laptop OS's and my desktop, in hindsight it would have been a lot easier to just use a single device for the whole project. On the subject of version control, I could have utilized branches to divide parts of my project into multiple parts. For example, each trait analysis could have its own branch, etc.. Anyways, the important part is that I learned enough of Git to get by (hehe), so I think that's good enough.</p>
